 Ruby on Rails Capstone Project: Redesign of Twitter

> In this project I built a Job opinion application based on a redesign of Twitter.

Some of the advanced concepts explored in this project includes.
- Working with advanced associations, many-to-many relationships, a typical twitter follow and follower relationship model.
- Authentication using Devise
- Used RSpec as the test suit with the help of shoulda-matchers and capybara for effective testing. Both unit and integration testing was done.
- Used paperclip gem to achieve image upload for profile photo and cover image
